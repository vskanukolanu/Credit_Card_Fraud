**Aim:** Building a model to detect fraud in credit card transactions

The credit card transactions data set from Kaggle is highly imbalanced. Project involves building the model deal with class imbalance with the main aim to detect fraud.
Precision and Recall are the main evaluation metrics used and also Area under Precision-Recall Curves as the classes are imbalanced.

**Techniques Used**
1. Logistic Regression
2. Balanced Bagging i.e. undersampling of majority class and bagging using Logistic estimators.
3. Cross-validation
