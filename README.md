**Aim:** Building a model to detect fraud in credit card transactions

The credit card transactions data set from Kaggle is highly skewed in class distribution. This project involves building a model to predict fraudulent transactions by using techniques to effectively handle class imbalance.
Precision and Recall are the main evaluation metrics used and also Area under Precision-Recall Curves as the classes are imbalanced.

**Techniques Used**
1. Logistic Regression
2. SMOTE and SMOTEENN
3. Cross-validation
4. Random Forests with penality on minority class missclassification
5. Hyperparameter tuning of Random Forests
